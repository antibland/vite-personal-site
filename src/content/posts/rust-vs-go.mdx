Both Rust and Go are popular choices for systems programming. Let's compare them in real-world scenarios.

## Error Handling

Different approaches to handling errors:

```rust
// Rust
fn divide(a: i32, b: i32) -> Result<i32, &'static str> {
    if b == 0 {
        return Err("Division by zero");
    }
    Ok(a / b)
}
```

```go
// Go
func divide(a, b int) (int, error) {
    if b == 0 {
        return 0, errors.New("division by zero")
    }
    return a / b, nil
}
```

More language comparisons coming soon!
