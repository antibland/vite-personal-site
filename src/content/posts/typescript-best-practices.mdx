TypeScript continues to grow in popularity, and with good reason. Let's explore some best practices that will make your TypeScript code more maintainable and type-safe.

## Type Inference vs Explicit Types

TypeScript's type inference is powerful, but when should you let it work its magic, and when should you be explicit?

## The Power of Generics

Generics are one of TypeScript's most powerful features. Here's how to use them effectively:

```typescript
function identity<T>(arg: T): T {
  return arg;
}
```

## Advanced Types

Understanding advanced types can make your code more expressive:

- Union Types
- Intersection Types
- Mapped Types
- Conditional Types
