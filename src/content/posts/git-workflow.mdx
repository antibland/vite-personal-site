A solid Git workflow is essential for team collaboration. Let's explore some best practices.

Writing meaningful commit messages:

```bash
# Bad
git commit -m "fix bug"

# Good
git commit -m "fix: prevent racing of requests in user authentication"
```

## Branch Strategy

Using Git Flow effectively:

```bash
# Feature branch
git checkout -b feature/user-auth

# Hotfix branch
git checkout -b hotfix/login-crash
```
