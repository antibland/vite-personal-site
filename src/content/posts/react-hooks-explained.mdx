React Hooks revolutionized how we write React components. Let's explore the most important hooks and when to use them.

## useState: Managing Component State

The most basic hook, but incredibly powerful:

```javascript
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
```

## useEffect: Side Effects in Components

Perfect for data fetching, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM:

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  document.title = `Count: ${count}`;
}, [count]);
```

More examples coming soon!
