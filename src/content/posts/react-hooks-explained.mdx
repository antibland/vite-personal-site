React Hooks revolutionized how we write React components. Let's explore the most important hooks and when to use them.

> The introduction of Hooks in React 16.8 was a game-changer. They enable you to use state and other React features without writing class components.

## useState: Managing Component State

The most basic hook, but incredibly powerful. Here's a simple counter implementation:

```javascript
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
const increment = () => setCount((prev) => prev + 1);
```

Some key points about `useState`:

1. It returns an array with exactly two values
2. The first value is the current state
3. The second value is a function to update the state
4. Never call hooks inside loops or conditions

## useEffect: Side Effects in Components

Perfect for data fetching, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM:

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  document.title = `Count: ${count}`;

  // Cleanup function (optional)
  return () => {
    document.title = "React App";
  };
}, [count]);
```

> **Best Practice**: Always include a cleanup function when dealing with subscriptions or event listeners to prevent memory leaks.

### Common useEffect Patterns

Here are some patterns you'll often encounter:

1. **Data Fetching**

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  const fetchData = async () => {
    const response = await fetch("https://api.example.com/data");
    const data = await response.json();
    setData(data);
  };

  fetchData().catch(console.error);
}, []);
```

2. **Event Listeners**

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  const handleResize = () => {
    setWindowWidth(window.innerWidth);
  };

  window.addEventListener("resize", handleResize);
  return () => window.removeEventListener("resize", handleResize);
}, []);
```

## Custom Hooks: Reusing Logic

One of the most powerful features of hooks is the ability to create custom hooks. Here's a simple example:

```javascript
function useLocalStorage(key, initialValue) {
  const [storedValue, setStoredValue] = useState(() => {
    try {
      const item = window.localStorage.getItem(key);
      return item ? JSON.parse(item) : initialValue;
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(error);
      return initialValue;
    }
  });

  const setValue = (value) => {
    try {
      setStoredValue(value);
      window.localStorage.setItem(key, JSON.stringify(value));
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(error);
    }
  };

  return [storedValue, setValue];
}
```

> **Pro Tip**: Custom hooks are an excellent way to share stateful logic between components. They follow the same rules as regular hooks and can call other hooks inside them.

### When to Create a Custom Hook

Consider creating a custom hook when you find yourself:

- Repeating similar stateful logic in multiple components
- Managing complex local state
- Handling side effects that could be reused

## Rules of Hooks

1. Only call hooks at the top level
2. Only call hooks from React function components
3. Name custom hooks starting with "use"

> **Warning**: Breaking these rules can lead to bugs and unexpected behavior in your React applications.

Remember, hooks are just JavaScript functions, but they impose two additional rules:

- They must be called in the exact same order every render
- They must be called from React function components or custom hooks

Happy coding! ðŸš€
