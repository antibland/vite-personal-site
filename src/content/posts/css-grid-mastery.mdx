CSS Grid has transformed how we approach web layouts. Let's explore some advanced techniques.

## Grid Template Areas

One of the most intuitive features of Grid:

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-areas:
    "header header"
    "sidebar content"
    "footer footer";
}
```

## Auto-Fit vs Auto-Fill

Understanding the difference:

```css
.container {
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(200px, 1fr));
}
```
