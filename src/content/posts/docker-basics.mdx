Docker has revolutionized how we deploy applications. Let's start with the basics.

## Your First Dockerfile

Creating a simple Node.js application container:

```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

## Docker Compose

Managing multiple containers:

```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
  db:
    image: postgres
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: example
```

More Docker examples coming soon!
