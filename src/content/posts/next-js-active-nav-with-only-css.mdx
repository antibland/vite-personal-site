Anyone who has worked on a web application with a navigation section has probably encountered a time where they've wanted to highlight the current nav item.

  Your browser does not support the video tag.

I recently ran into this using Next.js and, according to their developer advocate, [the recommended solution](https://x.com/asidorenko_/status/1812855952380457259) is to create a client component and add the following code:

```tsx
"use client";
const pathname = usePathname();

<Link
  href={pathname}
  className={clsx("nav-item", {
    "nav-item-active": pathname === href,
  })}
>
  {children}
</Link>;
```

It seems pretty straightforward, but it's not without a major drawback. Next is forcing us to use client-side navigation. This means that the active nav item is not active until the page is loaded and all client javascript is executed. The need for a client-side hook just to decorate an active nav item seems like the framework is asking too much of developers. For someone like me who has prioritized the adoption of server-side rendering whenever possible, the CSS part of my brain lit up. I realized that this could be accomplished without any additional client-side JavaScript or the need to create yet another component.

## Enter `:has()`

> The functional :has() CSS pseudo-class represents an element if any of the relative selectors that are passed as an argument match at least one element when anchored against this element. This pseudo-class presents a way of selecting a parent element or a previous sibling element with respect to a reference element by taking a relative selector list as an argument.

My mental model of `:has()` is somewhat crude but more concise.

> 1. Establish a parent.
> 2. Find a selector/condition within the parent's children.
> 3. Go "back up" to the parent and apply the styles.

## The CSS Solution

In our page components, we're going to add an `id` to the `main` elemenet.

For example, here's the RSC home page.

```tsx
export default function Home() {
  return (
    <main id="home" className="...">
      <h1>Home</h1>
    </main>
  );
}
```

And here is our RSC sidebar.

```tsx
export default function Sidebar() {
  return (
    <aside className="...">
      <h1 className="...">Side Nav</h1>
      <ul className="...">
        <li>
          <a href="/">Home</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="/about">About</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="/contact">Contact</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </aside>
  );
}
```

Finally, we'll add the CSS to highlight the active nav item.

```css
:has(#home) aside a[href="/"] {
  color: red;
}
```

Remember that our `:has` is starting from the root of the document. Once we find the `#home`, we "go back up" to the `aside` and find the `a[href="/"]` and apply the styles.

Pretty cool, right? Now let's recap the pros and cons of this approach.

### Pros

- No client-side JavaScript!
- No need to create a new component
- No need to use `clsx` or `twMerge`
- No need to use `usePathname`

### Cons

- Requires a little additional markup
- Requires hardcoding the `id` in the `main` element to the path of the page

To this last point, you can see how the CSS needs to grow to support more pages.

```css
:has(#home) aside a[href="/"],
:has(#about) aside a[href="/about"],
:has(#contact) aside a[href="/contact"] {
  color: red;
}
```
