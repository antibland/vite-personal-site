Vim is more than just an editor - it's a way of thinking about text manipulation. Let's explore some advanced techniques.

## Text Objects

The power of Vim's text objects:

```vim
# Delete inside parentheses
di(

# Change inside quotes
ci"

# Visual select inside brackets
vi[
```

## Macros

Recording and playing back commands:

```vim
# Start recording to register 'q'
qq

# Your commands here...

# Stop recording
q

# Play back macro
@q
```
